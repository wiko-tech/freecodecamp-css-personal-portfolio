## ℹ️ Personal Portfolio Website

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A sleek and responsive portfolio website to showcase my early frontend projects which includes an about section, project gallery, and a contact section with placeholder links to social profiles.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This website serves as an example personal portfolio website, designed to present who I am as a budding frontend developer. It provides an overview of the projects I’ve built so far and invites potential collaborators to get in touch.

From layout structure to responsive behaviors, every section is carefully crafted with clean design and accessibility in mind. I also included a subtle dark-themed aesthetic using `radial-gradient` backgrounds and hover interactions for a more modern UI feel.
